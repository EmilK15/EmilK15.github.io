							<h1>About me</h1>
						</div>
					</div>
				    <p>I am a 4th year Computer Science student going to University of Windsor. I have had a 16-month internship in the past at IBM which gave me a perspective of what the industry is looking for.</p>
				    <p>I like to head out downtown and am a big EDM fan, in fact I really like all varieties of music, and that drives much of what I do in my spare time. I also like boxing and rock climbing, but now I head to the gym to keep a good routine going.</p>
				    <p>After working for a year I have a good idea of what sort of lifestyle I want to live, and that includes the kind of work I want to do. If I am passionate about something I am a one-man hype train to keep myself going until I see it through.</p>
				    <p>When I talk to different people I see that there are two types of students, ones who know what they want and see a path to get there, and thus try to follow their goals. Other people who still aren't quite sure and that drains their motivation to move forward.</p>
				    <p>I am still learning about myself, but I am striving to be the former rather than the latter. I do have a short-term goal of working either as a Full-Stack Developer/Java Developer. While JavaScript, PHP, and Node.js are all still things that are new to me, it doesn't deter me from wanting to see where it takes me.</p>

				<p>I am currently making this small-time application so that people who need advice can get it anytime. Anybody who gives advice can receive advice from other people as well.</p>
				<p>I called it HypeCity because sometimes we need another person to help motivate us not just with our jobs, but with trying something new, dating, lifestyle advice and more.</p>
				<p>I was thinking about it when I was deciding whether or not to head out by myself one night to an event where I knew nobody. Most of my friends were either busy or didn't want to go, so I had to motivate myself to do it. I think that in those moments we sometimes need a little push to do something outside our comfort zone.</p>
